### Hello, I'm Melissa ðŸ‘‹

- :nerd_face: I'm currently a CS post-baccalaureate student at OSU.
- :microscope: By day, I work as an electron microscopist.
- :computer: This GitHub hosts a few school projects I'm able to share publicly.
- :woman_shrugging: What do I hope to do with this degree? Good question! I originally started this program because I wanted to supplement my career in materials science with computer science. Now, I'm not so sure so I'm just enjoying the process of learning and exploring different career paths in CS.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a strong preference towards 24 hour time and the metric system. 
- :mountain_biking_woman:	:running_woman: :mountain: :climbing_woman: Ask me about: my favorite mountain biking trails, what I'm growing in my garden, trail running, climbing, XC skiing, or pretty much anything that has something to do with the outdoors.
